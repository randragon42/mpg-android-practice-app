# MPG Tracker
MPG Tracker is an Android application for tracking vehicle fuel consumption.

## App Progress
This app is currently under development. Once [MVP goals](https://github.com/randragon42/mpg-android-practice-app/projects/1) and a few of the [Stretch Goals](https://github.com/randragon42/mpg-tracker/projects/2) are met, I plan to release the app on the Google Play store.

## App Features
The goal of this app is to make it easy to track and analyze vehicle fuel consumption.
This is done by gathering information every time the user fills up their gas tank.

The information is compiled into the following information:
- A list of all past trips
- Graphs to show trends between trips
  + Miles per gallon for each trip
  + Distances for each trip
  + Costs for each trip
- Overall trip statistics (max values, averages, and totals)
